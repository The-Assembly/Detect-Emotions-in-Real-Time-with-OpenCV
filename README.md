# Detect-Emotions-in-Real-Time-with-OpenCV
In a previous session in March, we showed you how to train a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) using TensorFlow to detect human emotions from facial expressions with great accuracy (link to session: https://youtu.be/ctjkZnQF_FY)  In this workshop, we’ll take our deep learning model live by integrating it with OpenCV to process real-time video. We’ll capture expressions directly from the webcam and run them through our CNN to get a reading on mood and emotion instantly.
